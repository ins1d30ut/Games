## Welcome to ins1d30ut's twisted way of playing with `python`

This is just a simple repo that is meant to demo some playing with python. Thanks for `tuning in`. I have no clue if this will be useful to anyone other than myself. If it is, send me all your money. If it isn't, send me all your money anyways! I accept BitcoinSV payments to the paymail
`ins1d30ut@moneybutton.com`. If you do not know whaht BitcoinSV is, download the crappy application handcashapp @ https://handcash.io - you can actually use this wallet to play games that are semi-cool with. Cheers! Buy me some beers!

### To run the individual programs, make sure that you are in the proper directory on your computer when executing the `python file.py` command.
